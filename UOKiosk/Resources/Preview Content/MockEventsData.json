In the latter case, Martín has been the first Spaniard to reach the final of the most relevant piano event worldwide, achieved previously by Maurizio Pollini, Krystian Zimerman or Martha Argerich. García García has offered more than 70 performances during 2022 in Asia, United States, Europe, and Spain. Notably, his debut at Carnegie Hall in New York and a successful tour of Japan, attended by more than 25,000 spectators in 14 performances.

This role is represented in the ritualization of space on a micro and a macro level: Just as the design of ceremonial robes donned for ritual performances placed the emperor at the center of the cosmos, the layout of the capital designated the imperial palace and its government precincts as the ritual center of the political realm. This presentation explores two cases that demonstrate how the ancient roots of such ritual representations were used in the legitimization of power in China’s turbulent 20th and 21st centuries.

                "description_text": "Don't miss out on this event brought to you by the University of Oregon Veteran Program, UO LGBTESS Program,  and the Oregon Department of Veterans Affairs! Breaking the Silence: An Oral History of LGBTQ+ Veterans and Service Members is a groundbreaking film that will leave you in awe. This film chronicles the lives and experiences of five LGBTQ+ Oregonians who served their country honorably, even though official military policy sought to prohibit them from doing so.\n\nThese courageous people risked everything to serve their country, and their stories are both inspiring and heart-wrenching. Breaking the Silence tells the story of our nation's military that you haven't heard, one in which LGBTQ+ service members faced not only the risks that are common to those who serve but also the risk of discovery, disgrace, and even prosecution, simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nJoin us from 6 to 8 pm at the University of Oregon’s Living Learning Center Performance Hall, for a screening of this powerful film. A Q&A session will follow the screening, with a guest speaker in attendance. This event is open to LGBTQ+ veterans and their friends and family, veterans, advocates, and allies who want to understand better how to serve and support this underrepresented community.\n\nBut that's not all! Concessions will be provided, including free popcorn, candy, non-alcohol refreshments, and hot dogs available for purchase from a local vendor. Early registrations receive one free hot dog, and early registration with a free hot dog will close on May 8, 2023. However, regular registration will be closing on May 10, 2023. Hot dogs will be available for purchase while supplies last.\n\nJoin us for this powerful event to honor our LGBTQ+ veterans and service members and to continue the fight for visibility and acceptance for this group in the armed forces. Breaking the Silence will leave you moved, inspired, and ready to stand in solidarity with Oregon’s LGBTQ+ veteran community. This is an event you cannot miss!",

                "description_text": "Get Practice Video Interview Experience with Guest Employer:\n\nSteve Gaube, Supervisory Public Utilities Specialist, Market Policy & Pricing\n\nBonneville Power Administration (BPA)\n\nDeadline to sign-up: May 9th, 2023 by 11:55 pm\n\nThe University Career Center's practice interview program is a safe place to practice interview skills, gain confidence and receive real-time interview feedback from an experienced hiring professional. Practice interviews are 30 minutes in length--20 minutes for the interview and ~10 minutes for feedback. Students will not be interviewing for a specific position but should be prepared to respond to general behavioral-based interview questions. You DO NOT need to have specific interest in the organization in order to participate--the goal is to gain interview experience.\n\n \n\nWhy Sign-up for a Practice Interview?\n\nKnowing what to expect and how to prepare will lead to successful future interviews. Success begins with preparation.Receive immediate interview feedback from the guest employer.Practice makes better! Get a jump start on your job search, boost your interview skills and increase your chances for a successful interview the next time you're in front of an employer.Interviewing Tips and Resources – Interview with Confidence\n\nCareer Center resources: https://career.uoregon.edu/interviewing-tips-and-resourcesCareer Center’s Big Interview – a new free online interviewing program that combines training and practice to help improve your interview technique and build confidence. Click “Register” button and use your “@uoregon.edu” email address to access: https://uoregon.biginterview.comHandshake's \"How to Make a Good Impression in a Virtual Job Interview”: https://learn.joinhandshake.com/students/how-to-make-a-good-impression-in-a-virtual-job-interview/ \n\nABOUT BPA and GUEST EMPLOYER\n\nMy organization is Market Analysis & Policy. We employ a variety of sophisticated analytical techniques to build expertise in energy markets, which we use to inform agency strategy for marketing energy-related products. We also partner with regional stakeholders to design and build the organized energy markets of the future. I love this team because we have earned a reputation for solving problems and answering questions that stump everyone else. I hire under multiple job titles, but they are all essentially “analyst.” The necessary skill sets are R proficiency and strong communication skills, but the biggest drivers of success are a detective mentality and a willingness to take risks/innovate. \n\n \n\nI am a UO graduate with a degree in Business Administration (Finance) and Economics. I enjoy attending home football games in the fall (season ticket holder since 2006) along with the occasional track meet or basketball game. Go Ducks!\n\n \n\n[Video interview link will be sent to scheduled students (1) day prior to interview. Students not able to get a practice interview slot will be added to a 'wait-list' and will still have resume forwarded to guest employer]\n\n \n\nTHIS IS A PRACTICE INTERVIEW and is a program of the University Career Center's On-Campus Recruiting Program (OCR). Missing a scheduled practice interview is unprofessional and guarantees disqualification from Handshake privileges.

I will talk about my work and my background as a printmaker. I will also discuss how printmaking continues to inform the way I make my recent sculptural works.” Yoonmi Nam, 2023\n\nYoonmi Nam received her MFA degree from the Rhode Island School of Design and BFA degree from Hong-Ik University in Seoul, Korea. She was awarded residencies at Mokuhanga Innovation Laboratory in Japan three times (2004, 2012, 2019) to study traditional Japanese woodblock printing techniques and is the recipient of the Keiko Kadota Award for Advancement of Mokuhanga. She has participated in artist residencies at Brandywine Workshop and Archives in Philadelphia, Frans Masereel Centrum in Belgium, Kala Art Institute in California, Vermont Studio Center, and a 3-year studio residency at Studios Inc. in Kansas City.

It is a measure of how much working memory is being used to process information or complete a task. There are three constituent components of overall cognitive load but for the purpose of this talk, I will be speaking about extraneous cognitive load. The cognitive demands imposed on working memory and are not directly related to the task!

If the educator or environment doesn’t manage extraneous loads, individuals will suffer impaired performance, or worse, hinder learning. As you know, we are all built differently. \n\nMy lab examines underlying abilities that afford reduction to extraneous cognitive loads, specifically individual spatial and haptic abilities.  These abilities are personal and often unknown to our learners and learning leaders.  If the abilities are low yet out learning activities, laboratory tasks, or worse, assessments require it, learners underachieve despite meeting most learning objectives.  I will share and demonstrate some of our experience with these variables, so you know can recognize them in your own learning environments and witness how they interact with learning.  We will have the opportunity to try some spatial tests and see a live haptic tests.  \n\nAt the end of the presentation, I predict you will understand your own abilities better.  In doing so, you will be better prepared as a learner and an educator, to recognize and control extraneous cognitive loads that may be related to spatial and haptic abilities in your own fields of study and andragogy.",

I argue that our lived, embodied, and imagined experiences inform our affective engagement with texts, be it intimate or critical. In this paper, I close-read iconic Bollywood movies like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999) from an affective gendered perspective. How I perceived these movies once as a young Bangladeshi girl is very different from how I (mis)recognize them today as an international woman of color in the U.S.A. These socio-academic migrational subjectivities are accompanied by my neurodiverse intersectionalities; all of which, together, make up my modes of engagement. Through my talk, I want to lead others to view or review these movies from my affective perspective(s) and thus demonstrate how affect can be a valid form of analytical practice and pedagogy.\" Attend in person, 330 Hendricks Hall, or by Zoom.",

Moreover, more than 80 million remain as refugees and internally displaced peoples worldwide (UNHCR 2022). While four-fifths of this global refugee population is hosted by developing countries in Africa and Asia, citizens from war-torn Muslim nations such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia continue to top the list of asylum seekers in the developed world. Protracted political crisis in many regions over the last few decades inevitably created a dispersal of Muslim minorities to many parts of the world. These new communities often settle in areas where ethnic composition, religious practices, and political and economic structures drastically differ from those in their home countries. This presentation outlines the complex local and global migration policies and outcomes that refugees often navigate in their various settlements. I will combine larger theoretical debates on migration with refugee narratives drawing from my work with Somali refugees in various parts of the globe over the last 20 years.\n\nSponsored by: UO's Global Justice Program",

Russia has launched the largest war on the continent since 1945, offering nationalist justifications for seeking to dismantle Ukraine. It has provoked a shift in Germany and other European states toward larger military spending that long seemed unimaginable. It has also created enormous pressure to accelerate change in Europe’s energy sources, plus a massive refugee crisis. Europe’s response to these classic threats to security and resources, however, has been shaped powerfully by the supranational European Union. Widely seen as weak amid many recent crises—debt, refugees, eastern European quasi-authoritarianism, Brexit, the pandemic—the EU is now reasserting itself. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has taken a leading role in the response to Russia.

While that is often the case, there are also many examples—both historical and contemporary—where members of otherwise seemingly aligned groups have navigated tension based on differences in perspective, approach, and even objectives. In some instances, these differences have led to strategic advantages and the development of specified roles in social justice spaces. In others, they have not.     \n\nIn her talk “Down for the Cause: Grace, Space, and Belonging in Social Movements” civil rights lawyer and disability rights advocate Britney Wilson will explore the meaning, nature, and limitations of alignment in the context of social movements and advocacy, including whether and when alignment coincides with shared personal identity or experience and when it does not. She will also consider how and why members of marginalized groups may seek to protect and maintain self-determination over their own experiences and the impact of the concept of “belonging” on quests for external support. In doing so, Wilson will evaluate whether and how societal structures, including but not limited to, racism and ableism, affect strategy and positioning within social justice causes and potentially challenge the sense of “belonging” often believed to be inherent in such spaces.  \n\nBritney Wilson is an associate professor of Law and Director of the Civil Rights and Disability Justice Clinic at New York Law School. Prior to NYLS, Wilson was a staff attorney at the National Center for Law and Economic Justice, a Bertha Justice Fellow at the Center for Constitutional Rights, and a Marvin M. Karpatkin Fellow in the Racial Justice Program at the American Civil Liberties Union. Born with Cerebral Palsy, Wilson has written and spoken extensively about disability and the intersection of race and disability for various media outlets, including The Nation, Longreads, and This American Life. She has also testified about issues facing people with disabilities before both local and international governing bodies, including the New York City Council and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  \n\nAlso an accomplished writer and artist, Wilson has published and performed short stories, creative nonfiction essays, and poetry, including on the HBO series Brave New Voices. \n\nWilson’s talk is the Oregon Humanities Center’s 2022–23 Tzedek Lecture and is part of its 2022–23 Belonging series. The lecture is free and open to the public and will be livestreamed. Register.",
